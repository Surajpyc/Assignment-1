# Simple Arithmetic Operations Program

This Python script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-input numbers.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input two numbers.
2. The script then calculates:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
3. The results of each operation are printed.

## Python Code

```python
first_number = float(input("enter first number: "))
second_number = float(input("enter second number: "))
add = first_number + second_number
sub = first_number - second_number
mul = first_number * second_number
div = first_number / second_number
print("Addition =", add)
print("Subtraction =", sub)
print("Multiplication =", mul)
print("division =", div)
```

## Example

```
enter first number: 10
enter second number: 2
Addition = 12.0
Subtraction = 8.0
Multiplication = 20.0
division = 5.0
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
